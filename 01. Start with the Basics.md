Let's delve into the first section: **Integers and Whole Numbers**, **Decimals and Fractions**, and **Fundamental Arithmetic Operations**.

### 1. Integers and Whole Numbers

**Integers**: 
- Integers are a set of numbers that include all whole numbers and their negative counterparts.
- They can be represented on a number line, which extends infinitely in both the positive and negative directions.
- Examples: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

**Whole Numbers**:
- Whole numbers are a subset of integers that include all non-negative numbers.
- They start from zero and include all positive integers.
- Examples: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

**Key Points**:
- The number zero is considered both a whole number and an integer.
- Whole numbers do not include negative numbers, whereas integers do.
- In mathematical operations, integers follow specific rules, such as the addition of two positive integers always being positive, and the addition of two negative integers always being negative.

### 2. Decimals and Fractions

**Decimals**:
- Decimals are a way of representing fractions or parts of a whole using a base-10 system.
- A decimal number has two parts: the whole number part and the fractional part, separated by a decimal point.
- Examples: 0.75, 2.5, 3.14.

**Fractions**:
- A fraction represents a part of a whole and consists of a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).
- Fractions can be proper (numerator < denominator), improper (numerator > denominator), or mixed (a whole number and a fraction).
- Examples: 1/2, 3/4, 5/3.

**Converting Between Decimals and Fractions**:
- To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.
- To convert a decimal to a fraction, write the decimal as a fraction with 1 as the denominator and then multiply numerator and denominator by 10 until you have an integer numerator.

**Key Points**:
- Decimals and fractions can represent the same value in different forms.
- Understanding how to convert between them is essential for various calculations.

### 3. Fundamental Arithmetic Operations

**Addition (+)**:
- Combining two or more numbers to get a sum.
- Example: 3 + 2 = 5.

**Subtraction (-)**:
- Finding the difference between two numbers by removing the value of one from another.
- Example: 5 - 3 = 2.

**Multiplication (×)**:
- Repeated addition of the same number.
- Example: 3 × 4 = 12 (which is the same as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3).

**Division (÷)**:
- Splitting a number into equal parts or groups.
- Example: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

**Key Points**:
- The order of operations is crucial in calculations, commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) or BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).
- Operations with integers follow specific rules, such as the addition of two positive integers resulting in a positive sum, and the multiplication of two negative integers resulting in a positive product.
