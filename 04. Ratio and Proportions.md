### Section 4: Ratio and Proportions

Ratio and proportions are fundamental mathematical concepts used to compare quantities and understand relationships between numbers. They are widely applicable in various fields, including finance, science, and everyday life.

#### 1. **Ratio**

A ratio is a way of comparing two quantities by showing the relative size of one quantity to another. Ratios can be written in several forms:
- Using a colon, e.g., 3:4
- As a fraction, e.g., \( \frac{3}{4} \)
- In words, e.g., "3 to 4"

**Example**: If there are 2 apples and 3 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3.

**Properties of Ratios**:
- Ratios can be simplified just like fractions. For example, a ratio of 10:15 can be simplified to 2:3 by dividing both terms by 5.
- Ratios are unitless, meaning they compare quantities of the same kind without considering units.

**Uses of Ratios**:
- Ratios are used to compare quantities in various situations, such as mixing ingredients, comparing speeds, or analyzing data.

#### 2. **Proportion**

A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equivalent. If \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \), then \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are said to be in proportion, and it can be written as \( a:b = c:d \).

**Example**: If a car travels 100 km in 2 hours, the proportion of distance to time is \( 100:2 \). If another car travels 150 km in 3 hours, the proportion is \( 150:3 \). The two ratios, \( \frac{100}{2} \) and \( \frac{150}{3} \), are equal, so the cars travel at the same speed.

**Properties of Proportions**:
- Cross-multiplication is used to check if two ratios form a proportion: \( a \times d = b \times c \).
- Proportions are used to solve problems involving equivalent ratios, such as scaling recipes, maps, or models.

#### 3. **Direct and Inverse Proportions**

**Direct Proportion**:
In a direct proportion, as one quantity increases, the other also increases in the same ratio. Conversely, as one decreases, the other decreases in the same ratio. The relationship can be expressed as \( y = kx \), where \( k \) is a constant.

**Example**: If the cost of apples is directly proportional to the weight purchased, and 2 kg costs $6, then 3 kg will cost $9.

**Inverse Proportion**:
In an inverse proportion, as one quantity increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. The relationship can be expressed as \( xy = k \) or \( y = \frac{k}{x} \), where \( k \) is a constant.

**Example**: If the speed of a vehicle increases, the time taken to cover a fixed distance decreases. If a car takes 2 hours to cover a distance at 60 km/h, it will take 1 hour to cover the same distance at 120 km/h.

#### 4. **Applications of Ratios and Proportions**

- **In Recipes and Cooking**: Ratios are used to maintain the correct proportions of ingredients.
- **In Map Reading**: The scale of a map is a ratio that represents the proportion of distance on the map to the actual distance on the ground.
- **In Finance**: Ratios are used to analyze financial statements, such as the debt-to-equity ratio.
- **In Everyday Decisions**: Ratios help in comparing prices, quantities, and understanding value for money.

### Importance of Understanding Ratios and Proportions

Understanding ratios and proportions is crucial for problem-solving and making informed decisions in daily life and various professional fields. It allows for the comparison of different quantities and understanding the relationships between them, making it easier to interpret data, solve practical problems, and reason quantitatively.
