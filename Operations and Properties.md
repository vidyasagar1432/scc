**Section 3: Operations and Properties**
===============================

### 1. BODMAS (Order of Operations)
--------------------------------

**BODMAS** is an acronym that helps remember the order of operations in mathematical expressions. It stands for:

* **B**: Brackets
* **O**: Orders (exponents, including roots)
* **D**: Division
* **M**: Multiplication
* **A**: Addition
* **S**: Subtraction

The order of operations is crucial because it ensures consistency and accuracy in solving mathematical expressions. The standard order is:

1. **Brackets**: Solve expressions inside parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}` first.
2. **Orders**: Evaluate exponents and roots, such as squares and square roots.
3. **Division and Multiplication**: Perform these operations from left to right.
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform these operations from left to right.

### Example 1:
Solve `2 + 3 × (2^2 - 1)`.

1. **Brackets**: `2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`
2. **Orders**: Already handled inside brackets.
3. **Multiplication**: `3 × 3 = 9`
4. **Addition**: `2 + 9 = 11`

So, the result is 11.

### Example 2:
Solve `8 - 4 ÷ 2 × 3 + 5`.

1. **Division**: `4 ÷ 2 = 2`
2. **Multiplication**: `2 × 3 = 6`
3. **Subtraction**: `8 - 6 = 2`
4. **Addition**: `2 + 5 = 7`

So, the result is 7.

### 2. Percentage
-------------

A **percentage** represents a fraction of 100. It is a way to express proportions, ratios, and comparisons in a standardized form.

### Formula:
To convert a fraction or a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100:
```
Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
```

### Basic Concepts:

1. **Finding a Percentage of a Number**:
    - To find `x%` of a number `n`, use the formula:
    ```
    Percentage of n = (x/100) × n
    ```
    Example: What is 20% of 50?
    ```
    Percentage = (20/100) × 50 = 10
    ```

2. **Converting a Fraction to a Percentage**:
    - Convert the fraction to a decimal and then to a percentage.
    ```
    Percentage = (Numerator/Denominator) × 100
    ```

    Example: Convert `3/4` to a percentage.
    ```
    Percentage = (3/4) × 100 = 75%
    ```

3. **Finding a Number from a Percentage**:
    - To find the whole number `n` when given a percentage and its value:
    ```
    n = Value / (x/100)
    ```

    Example: 20% of a number is 30. What is the number?
    ```
    Number = 30 / (0.2) = 150
    ```

4. **Percentage Increase and Decrease**:
    - **Increase**:
        ```
        Increase = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) × 100
        ```
        - **Decrease**:
        ```
        Decrease = ((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) × 100
        ```

    Example: The price of a product increased from $50 to $60. What is the percentage increase?
    ```
    Increase = ((60 - 50) / 50) × 100 = 20%
    ```

### Applications
----------------

* **Financial Calculations**: Understanding percentages is crucial for calculating interest rates, discounts, profit margins, and more.
* **Data Interpretation**: Percentages are commonly used in statistics and data analysis to present information in a clear and understandable way.

These concepts form the foundation of arithmetic operations and are widely used in everyday situations. Let me know if you'd like to explore further examples, practice problems, or any specific aspect of these topics!
