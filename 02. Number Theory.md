Section 2 covers **Number Theory**, focusing on **LCM and HCF** and the **Relationship between Numbers**.

### 1. LCM and HCF

**LCM (Least Common Multiple)**:
- The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers.
- To find the LCM:
  1. **Prime Factorization Method**: Break down each number into its prime factors and take the highest power of each prime number present in the factorization.
  2. **Listing Multiples Method**: List the multiples of each number until you find the smallest common multiple.
  3. **Division Method**: Divide the numbers by common prime factors until all numbers become 1.

**Example**:
- Find the LCM of 12 and 18.
  - Prime factorization:
    - 12 = 2² × 3
    - 18 = 2 × 3²
  - LCM = 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36

**HCF (Highest Common Factor)**:
- The HCF, also known as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), is the largest number that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.
- To find the HCF:
  1. **Prime Factorization Method**: Break down each number into its prime factors and take the lowest power of each prime number common to the factorizations.
  2. **Division Method**: Divide the larger number by the smaller number and then divide the divisor by the remainder. Continue this process until the remainder is 0; the last divisor is the HCF.
  3. **Listing Factors Method**: List the factors of each number and find the greatest factor common to both lists.

**Example**:
- Find the HCF of 12 and 18.
  - Prime factorization:
    - 12 = 2² × 3
    - 18 = 2 × 3²
  - HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 2 × 3 = 6

**Key Points**:
- LCM is useful when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators.
- HCF is useful in simplifying fractions or dividing things into smaller sections.

### 2. Relationship Between Numbers

**Prime Numbers**:
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
- 2 is the only even prime number.

**Composite Numbers**:
- A composite number is a number greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors.
- Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc.

**Even and Odd Numbers**:
- **Even Numbers**: Numbers divisible by 2. Examples: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.
- **Odd Numbers**: Numbers not divisible by 2. Examples: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.

**Divisibility Rules**:
- Rules that help quickly determine whether a number is divisible by another number without performing division. Some common rules include:
  - **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit is even.
  - **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
  - **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit is 0 or 5.

**Key Points**:
- Understanding the relationship between numbers, such as prime and composite, helps in factorization and simplifying expressions.
- Divisibility rules are handy shortcuts in arithmetic calculations and problem-solving.

These concepts are fundamental in number theory and play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect or need further clarification?

Let's delve deeper into **LCM (Least Common Multiple)** and **HCF (Highest Common Factor)** with more examples and methods.

### LCM (Least Common Multiple)

**Definition:**
The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers. It is useful for finding common denominators in fractions, scheduling events, and solving problems involving repeated patterns.

**Methods to Find LCM:**

1. **Prime Factorization Method:**
   - Write each number as a product of prime factors.
   - Take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - Multiply these together to get the LCM.

   **Example:**
   Find the LCM of 15 and 20.
   - 15 = 3 × 5
   - 20 = 2² × 5
   - LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60

2. **Listing Multiples Method:**
   - List the multiples of each number until you find the smallest common multiple.

   **Example:**
   Find the LCM of 4 and 5.
   - Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...
   - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, ...
   - Common multiples: 20, 40, ...
   - LCM = 20

3. **Division Method (Common Division Method):**
   - Write the numbers in a row and divide by prime numbers until all numbers become 1. The product of the prime divisors is the LCM.

   **Example:**
   Find the LCM of 6, 8, and 12.
   - 2 | 6, 8, 12
   - 2 | 3, 4, 6
   - 2 | 3, 2, 3
   - 3 | 3, 1, 3
   -    | 1, 1, 1
   - LCM = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 24

### HCF (Highest Common Factor)

**Definition:**
The HCF, also known as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), is the largest number that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. It is useful for simplifying fractions, finding the greatest possible grouping, and more.

**Methods to Find HCF:**

1. **Prime Factorization Method:**
   - Write each number as a product of prime factors.
   - Take the lowest power of each prime number common to the factorizations.
   - Multiply these together to get the HCF.

   **Example:**
   Find the HCF of 18 and 24.
   - 18 = 2 × 3²
   - 24 = 2³ × 3
   - Common factors: 2¹ × 3¹
   - HCF = 2 × 3 = 6

2. **Division Method (Euclidean Algorithm):**
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and then divide the divisor by the remainder. Repeat this process until the remainder is 0. The last divisor is the HCF.

   **Example:**
   Find the HCF of 56 and 98.
   - 98 ÷ 56 = 1, remainder 42
   - 56 ÷ 42 = 1, remainder 14
   - 42 ÷ 14 = 3, remainder 0
   - HCF = 14

3. **Listing Factors Method:**
   - List all the factors of each number and identify the largest common factor.

   **Example:**
   Find the HCF of 16 and 24.
   - Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
   - Factors of 24: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
   - Common factors: 1, 2, 4, 8
   - HCF = 8

### Relationship Between LCM and HCF

There is an interesting relationship between the LCM and HCF of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \). The product of the LCM and HCF is equal to the product of the numbers themselves:

\[ \text{LCM}(a, b) \times \text{HCF}(a, b) = a \times b \]

**Example:**
For numbers 8 and 12:
- LCM(8, 12) = 24
- HCF(8, 12) = 4
- \( 24 \times 4 = 8 \times 12 = 96 \)

This relationship can be helpful for checking your calculations or finding one of the values if the other is known.
